Ensure the injectors used are in the proper file paths that are in use in Inject-Process. It won't be enough to just clone the repo, the folders will need to be manually configured or the script updated. 

Set $home_folder and $results_folder. $home_folder needs to have sub-folders with a matching injector name. 

Inject-Process needs Analyse-Log to be loaded into memory already to work. It's there to parse out the logs, if you'd rather not do that just comment that section out

Inject-Process is currently set to just load the Hartong config. If you're wanting to do the full run change the start and end config loads between trace and Hartong
